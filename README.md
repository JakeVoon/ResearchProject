# TODO:
1. Program force sensing algorithm
   [X] Create fake data for validating segmenting algorithm \\
   [ ] Find algorithms for detecting break point locations

# Notes:
I'm currently building the algorithm in Jupyter Notebook so that I may write notes along with the code, but once its completed and validated, the algorithm will be moved into a Python file.
